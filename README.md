An experiment in creating a simple concurrency-friendly maze generator in Pony.
Eventual goal is for this to be a procedural generation toolkit for roguelikes and similar applications.

Algorithm(s) will be borrowed from roguebasin.

### How to use
* Install [Pony](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/blob/master/README.md#installation).
* Run `ponyc` in the root directory of this repository.
* ...
* Run the `./amble` binary.

### Algorithms Planned Thus Far
* [ ] [Simple Maze](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Simple_maze#Maze_Generator_in_Javascript)

#### Features:

* [X] Handles 2D coordinates.
* [ ] Handles 3D coordinates.
* [X] Handles 2D cardinal directions.
* [ ] Handles 3D directions.
* [ ] Handles 2D maps as a concept.
* [ ] Handles 3D maps as a concept.
* [X] Handles display of 2D map tiles.
* [ ] Implementation of above algorithms.
* [ ] Implementation a CLI tool with options.
